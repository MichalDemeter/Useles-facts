        <p>Hello! My name is Michael and I am from Central European country called Slovakia. I grew up playing Ice Hockey therefore I am interested in sports, however I like to study as well and I have developed a little addction to search informationss and learn new things as much as I can. During my searches through all kind of informations I came across some very interesting thins, studies that changed my point of view or my whole uderstanding of specific problems. I have managed to find some wierd and unexpected stuff as well. <br>
